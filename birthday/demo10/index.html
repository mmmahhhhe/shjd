              My favorite experience was spending the hackathon sitting together, stressing out over the amount of work we had to do, but still managing to pull through and kick our project's asses.

              The thing I admire most is how dedicated and hard working Shirley is. Everyone works hard at Harvard, but Shirley really takes that to a new level. And the best part is, she can still smile and be happy. While many of us use the amount of work we have as an excuse to be self centered, she never fails to be loving, caring, or thoughtful, and I admire that to no end.

              My favorite experience is from freshman year. It was my first time hanging out with Shirley and her friends in Thayer, and she was super welcoming. I loved pregaming with her and then traveling from party to party, always dancing and laughing :). She's the best!

              Watching her bring to life a beautiful creature of grace during her signature peacock dance at the annual Chinese New Year Festival celebration show at the Philip Arts Center in Gainesville, FL. (Yes---years ago). Best part of the show, every time.

              One of the first times I met Shirley, we were psetting late one night in Eliot dhall, and somehow there was a pencil stuck in the ceiling.  I was trying really hard to get the pencil out of the ceiling by throwing a frisbee at it.  Shirley thought this was funny, so I knew she was a cool person.
