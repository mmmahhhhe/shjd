				<h1>She Celebrates the Little Things</h1>
				<p>
					You cheer for your family in all of our endeavors, big and small. 
					And when the day is done, you toast to us, no matter the outcome.
					Don't think we don't notice the subtle way you raise your glass and say, 
					"Here's to ya". It's my favorite part of the night. 
					But not tonight, XX. Tonight we'll toast to you.

				<h1>She Creates Life on the Daily</h1>
				<p>
					You love to help things grow. Whether they be in the farm, or in your family,
					they're all in your heart. And it's so obvious, when you look at what remarkable 
					things spring up around you, that they are your doing. Without you I would not be
					the person I am today, and I know Carrie would say the same. We love you, XX!
				</p>
				<a class="close-reveal-modal">&#215;</a>

			<div id="treasure-modal" class="reveal-modal">
				<h1>She Holds On to What She Loves</h1>
				<p>You keep safe everything that you care about. People, books, drawings, pens -
					 the object itself does not matter. What matters is the value the object holds.
					 The more you collect, the more your color shows: you care. And that is a quality to
					 feel good about.

			<div id="comfort-modal" class="reveal-modal">
				<h1>She Comforts Me When I'm Down</h1>
				<p>When I'm sad, I come to you for cheering up. Not because you're my XX, or
					 because you're usually the person nearest to me. No, because you are the only
					 person I know who consistently makes me feel better. Whether it's advice I need, or
					 just a pat on the back, you always know exactly what to say. Thank you, XX.

				<h1>She Makes This House a Home</h1>
				<p>When we came to 977, the house was dark, gray, and without a heart. 
					 There were no flowers, and there was no heat. Quite honestly, at that point in time
					 I preferred the jaula.
					 But after a few weeks, as light began to shine on 977, I changed my mind.
					 Now, this change was little thanks to dad or me. It was you who turned this house 
					 into an incredible haven, XX. It was you who gave us all a cheerful place to call
					 home.

			<div id="lifesaver-modal" class="reveal-modal">
				<h1>She Saved My Life</h1>
				<p>I am quite certain that without you I would now be in a hospital, or else here, but 
					 far from sane. You risked your job and everything else
					 to talk me down every day. You inspired me to do saner things 
					 like get a therapist and start talking to real people. I know now that
					 I was so far down the rabbit hole, that without you holding my hand for over a year,
					 I would not have ever made it out. Thank you so much for 
					 risking everything for me, XX. I owe you my life.
